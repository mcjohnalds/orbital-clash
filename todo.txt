- Add rim lighting to flat looking planets then rerender
- Give pickups an idle sprite shader

Ideas:

- Use other sprite shaders on other things in the game
- Make nebula texture seamless
- Custom loading screen
- Different music at different times
- Random space ambient noises
- Change nebula color depending on distance to player/enemy planet
- Make start menu more interesting
- Play glitch effect or something when player is hit
- Apply screen effect depending on player health
- Sound volume depends on zoom level
- Make enemy planet indicator work better when planet is on screen
- Distant galaxies parallax layer
- Add voiceover
- Smooth enemy rotation
- Smooth zoom
- Camera pan acceleration
- Make HUD pretty
- Improve barrel to be more circular
- Gradual planet color transition
- Make barrel shader only apply to UI
- Test all the different scenarios that can happen when player dies
- Consistent button design
- When health or fuel is low, flash bar and play warning sound
- Handle when player hits enemy
- Set enemy spawns, moon spawns, and pickup spawns to never cross paths
- Play screen shader when fast forwarding
- Screen shader when paused
- Color vignette shader
- Make enemy planet indicator look good
- Add clouds to planets
- Make speed up go faster over time and raise the pitch
- Make trails exist in screen space
- Add particle effects and sounds for player for RCS thrusters
- Fix nebula colors
- Particle effects
  - Player hit
  - Player crash
  - Player death spiral
  - Enemy shoot
  - Planet captured
  - Pickup idle
  - Pickup collected
  - Bullet collision
  - Bullet disappear
  - Detect enemy planet, radar pulse and ping sound
- Initial experience is confusing for new players
  - It's not clear what the player is supposed to do
  - Players think the enemy planet indicator is pointing to the home planet so
    they "attack" the home planet
  - Players don't understand physics so they boost too much and overshoot their
    destination
- Bug: trails disappear when fast forwarding
